This philosophy grew from direct experience with enterprise-level, mission-critical systems, where one lesson became clear: project success is determined not by the complexity of the code, but by the clarity of the strategy and the strength of the architecture. That is why the CodeNovex approach focuses not on 'what' to build, but on 'why' it's being built and 'how' to build it right.",

      {

        "question": "What's the difference between a website and a web application?",
        "answer": "A website is typically a digital brochure-it provides information. A web application is a tool-it performs a specific task: automating a process, managing data, calculating a price, etc. "
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "question": "Why don't you have a fixed price list?",
        "answer": "Because we don't sell off-the-shelf products. Every business is unique, and so are its challenges. It's like asking, 'How much does it cost to build a house?'. The price depends on the size, materials, and complexity. Our 'Discovery' phase is dedicated to creating that blueprint, after which you receive a precise, transparent investment plan."
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "question": "How long does a project typically take?",
        "answer": "The timeline directly depends on the project's complexity. A simple system might take a few weeks, while a complex platform could take several months. Our agile, 2-week sprint system ensures that you see consistent progress and the process is fully predictable."

      {
        "id": 4,
        "question": "Do you offer support after the project is launched?",
        "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Our partnership doesn't end at launch. CodeNovex offers ongoing technical support, development, and strategic guidance to ensure your product continues to meet evolving business needs. We are committed to your long-term success."
      },
      {
        "id": 5,
        "question": "What technology stack do you use?",
        "answer": "CodeNovex is tech-agnostic, meaning we choose the best tool for the job, not just our favorite tool. However, our core expertise lies in modern technologies like React/Next.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. The guiding principle is simple: the technology must serve the business goal, not the other way around."

    "WHO_WE_ARE": "THE CODENOVEX PHILOSOPHY",
    "WHO_WE_ARE_TEXT": "CodeNovex was founded on a single principle: technology must solve a business problem, not just complete a task. This philosophy grew from direct experience with enterprise-level, mission-critical systems, where one lesson became clear: project success is determined not by the complexity of the code, but by the clarity of the strategy and the strength of the architecture. That is why the CodeNovex approach focuses not on 'what' to build, but on 'why' it's being built and 'how' to build it right."
